# Final Project Technigo Bootcamp - Florist Homepage/Webshop
In this project @https://github.com/elinaarenstrup and me made a homepage with a webshop for a florist where the customers can order bouquets for home delivery every friday.  
The backend was built with Node.js and Express and for the frontend we used React with Redux. 

## The problem
We wanted a page that would fit a small buisness owners needs. The customer can sign up/ sign in to order a boquet and the data is stored for the admin in Mongo.DB. 

## Upcoming features
*We will keep building on this project and the next steps will be to add more autorization to the backend

*An admin login for the florist to add more products to the database and also handle the customers. 

*Adding a “guestbook”/ “testimonial” section of the page when signed in. 

*Reuse some of the styled components

*More validation on the sign up form in the frontend to be more user friendly

## Tech we used

React Redux Node.js Express Mongo DB Mongoose JSX Javascript ES6 Styled Components Bcrypt
